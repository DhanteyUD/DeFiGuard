- <$50k = +10 risk points
- >$100k = Safe

### 3. Distribution (25% weight)

**Holder Concentration:**
- Top holder >70% = +25 risk points
- Top holder >50% = +15 risk points
- Top holder >30% = +10 risk points

**Token Age:**
- <7 days = +20 risk points
- <30 days = +10 risk points
- >90 days = Safe

### 4. Name Analysis (Bonus)

**Suspicious Keywords:**
- "safe", "moon", "elon", "baby", "inu" = +10 points each

## 🚨 Known Scam Patterns

### Honeypot Mechanics
```
1. Token allows buying
2. Smart contract prevents selling
3. User funds locked permanently
Result: Total loss
```

### Rug Pull Indicators
```
1. Unverified contract
2. Ownership not renounced
3. Hidden mint function
4. Liquidity not locked
Result: Developer drains liquidity
```

### Pump & Dump Pattern
```
1. Coordinated buy pressure
2. Price artificially inflated
3. Insiders dump holdings
4. Price crashes
Result: Late buyers lose money
```
